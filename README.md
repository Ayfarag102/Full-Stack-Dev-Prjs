# Full-Stack-Dev-Prjs

`All full stack projects`

`This repository contains all of my on-going and completed projects`


Several projects will be published during my progress in the following courses I am taking on [`Udemy.com`](https://www.udemy.com):

###### [`Angular & NodeJS - The MEAN Stack Guide`](https://www.udemy.com/share/1000nIB0sTcFZWQ3Q=/)

###### [`MERN Stack Front To Back: Full Stack React, Redux & Node.js`](https://www.udemy.com/share/100YFYB0sTcFZWQ3Q=/)

#### Completed Projects will have the status `"Complete"` - written next to it
#### Such as on-going projects will have the status `"In-Progress"` or `"On-Going"`
